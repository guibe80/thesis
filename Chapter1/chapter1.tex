Medicine at home is a concept that is looking into remotely monitor patients health with a minor intervention of medical practitioner. Thus, medical instruments capable of running safely at home requiring minimal mediation is the new trend in wearable devices. In the last years, a significant number of wearable technology or home care have been developed minimising unnecessary visits to medical centres and providing remote data to the practitioners.

One of the most valuable indicators of good health is the blood flow towards extremities. The information contains within this health parameter may indicate cardiovascular problems or the tendency of developing further issues related to other diseases like diabetes. An inadequate delivery of blood towards the extremities may lead to complications due to the lack of transport of oxygen and nutrients causing hypoxic events that may lead to ischemic tissue. A familiar name to denominate this kind of diseases is either peripheral vascular disease (PVD) or peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Nonetheless, the latter one focuses mostly when the blood reduction occurs in the arteries. Therefore, it is of great importance a method to also differentiate both kinds of events. The risk of developing PVD are hereditary factors and lifestyle choices. For instance, the combination of diabetes and smoking increments the chance of getting a PVD or complicating current diagnosis. If the illness is not treated on time, this may lead to the loss of the compromised limb.

These illnesses are progressive, thus if there was a method that could allow early detection or to prevent health deterioration, it could help to take corrective actions on time. Clinically, some methods or tests help clinicians to establish the development of these diseases. However, having a system that allows monitoring regularly changes in blood delivery would provide further information. Thus, better decisions could be made to create preventive methods to avoid new problems. 

Having a device capable of taking measurements at home collecting data would provide this additional health information. Some of the preferable characteristics of a device like that is that is simple to use, secure to use at home, portable and require minimum skill for operation. But one of the main considerations is that the instrument should be non-invasive or required intravenous aids to enhance measurements because then clinical personal might be needed.  

The blood delivery towards a limb can be estimated by estimating either the flow rate or the change of blood volume. Both parameters are well-recognised aid methods to study problems in the periphery. One of the most popular ways are instruments based on the Doppler technique. These can be applied with ultrasound or optical methods from where blood flow can be estimated. The Doppler methods have the potential to be used in a home environment, but it requires particular skills to place the sensor correctly. Moreover, it also measures a single point only focusing in either an artery, vein or the micro-circulation. 

Optical methods are quite accessible to measure changes of volume also known as Plethysmography and its relation with the absorption of oxygen in the deep tissue in a region of the body. Indeed, most of the new smartwatches available in the market measures heart rate based on this technology. Furthermore, blood flow rate can be estimated when using light in the near-infrared spectrum (NIRS) of the speed of movement of red cells with Laser Doppler techniques. The use of light is quite useful in a home setting, albeit its penetration is mostly superficial tissue. This is one of the limitations of this method, the volume of the tissue being monitored is quite small or shallow. It is not suitable for large volumes or deep tissue measurements. New methods like NIRS and optical imaging techniques look promising overcoming these drawbacks. Indeed, a system called Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is a suitable candidate to estimate blood circulation to a more comprehensive area of tissue with representation on a screen. However, again the signal obtained is just from the surface of the skin. 

The combination of two or more methods helps to improve the diagnostics of circulatory problems in the periphery. Moreover, it is possible to distinguish between arterial and venous problems by suppressing the effect of the venous return. This technique is known as venous occlusion plethysmography, which is applied to the limbs. By occluding on the upper section of the extremity, the venous blood is not able to return to the heart, raising the volume of the limb. By measuring, this increment is possible to gather information about the blood flow and the health of the veins in that part of the body. Therefore, this method needs two devices, one that blocks the venous blood commonly a pneumatic cuff and instrument to measure plethysmography. The latter can be achieved with different ways like chambers of air/water or strain gauges. Usually, using a chamber to measure plethysmography in a home setting can be quite cumbersome. Putting the arm in a tight cylinder filled with air or water and using a second hand to positioning other instruments do not fit within the principle of usability of a home device. On the other hand, strain gauges could be another option, but some sensors are filled with mercury, which is highly toxic. Some strain gauges can use another type of electrodes, but they are just confined to a small volume of tissue.

Bioelectrical impedance is a technique that can measure plethysmography and the amplitude of the arterial pulse. In short, the method called bioelectrical impedance plethysmography or simply impedance plethysmography (IPG) measures changes of blood volume by driving a tiny amount of current into the body and measuring the potential created by the blood flow. One of the advantages of this technique is that can measure a larger volume of tissue, not just a single vessel or superficial tissue. Due to the conductive nature of the human body, electric current flows smoothly through it and gaining a voltage measurement only a pair electrodes is required. This technology can be suitable for home, in fact, some manufacturers like Samsung \cite{simsense} are including this technology in their development of wearable products. As it can be seen, the miniaturisation of this technique is possible; it can be portable and easy to use. In fact, taking a useful measurement only needs four electrodes.

The information that bioelectrical impedance plethysmography can provide is quite rich and informative for circulatory problems. From this technology different methods have been developed to estimate plethysmography, blood flow and cardiac output using venous occlusion plethysmography or by just analysing the arterial pulses waveform. There have been developments where they concentrate on either the analysis of blood flow with venous occlusion or interpretation of the arterial pulses.

\section{Motivation and aims of the work}
This thesis has been written with the aim of explaining the development process of a bioelectrical impedance plethysmography device. This device must be able to operate in a home environment; therefore it must comply with patient safety within the established limits of the standards. For this, the device must be operated by batteries with the possibility of being portable. It must be simple to operate by using a minimum connection to the body.

The designed device must be able to work with venous occlusion plethysmography in the forearm as well as producing and arterial pulses for signal analysis. It must be demonstrated that the device can be used in a home setting providing reliable results compared to the ones observed in the literature. For this, an experimental set-up has to be carried on evaluating the performance of the device under three different circulatory conditions: normal blood flow, venous occlusion and total occlusion. The data obtained will be correlated with the measurements of other portable instruments like ultrasound Doppler, photoplethysmography and laser Doppler flowmetry.

The information obtained from the bioelectrical impedance plethysmography device is compared to other instruments in the experiment. The information obtained will provide clues of how well impedance plethysmography performs during each circulatory problem. Besides, from the waveform acquired, the blood flow rate will be deducted researching how the changes in arterial and venous circulation affect the shape of the waveform.


\section{Organisation of the thesis}
The thesis has been organised in different chapters with clinical and technical background. This document covers the application of bioelectrical impedance technology in medicine. Therefore the chapter 2 will provide background of the circulatory system including the blood and its transportation by vessels. Complementing this information, the cardiac cycle will explain how the changes of pressure and volume in the heart produces a typical changes of pressure to transport blood to the rest of the body. Due to the experiment procedure of the device was carried out in the upper extremity, a detailed anatomy of the arm is provided for reference when naming some parts of this extremity. After understanding, why monitor vascular problems could be useful for general health, this chapter will describe different instruments to measure changes of blood in a home setting. More details will be provided in plethysmographic technique and venous occlusion plethysmographic technique and how bioelectrical impedance plethysmography fits in this techniques. 

The chapter three will describe more in depth how bioelectrical impedance works and is measured. First, an introduction of how much electrical current should be applied to the human body, followed by the principle of electrical impedance and how complex impedance can be interpret. More in depth will be cover how impedance distributes as an ionic conduction from the electrodes boundary. The relation between electrical conduction and biology will be explored in the bioelectrical impedance section, where will be explored in more detail the relation between frequency and the human body. A brief technical introduction of the method will be provide with the basic components of an bioelectrical impedance device and the different measurements that can be obtained using different ways and electrode topologies. Understood this section, it will be studied in more depth the principle of bioelectrical impedance plethysmography and how the parallel model influences the measurement in cylinder shapes like in a human arm. Additionally, more details will be provided about bipolar and tetrapolar electrodes configurations. Finally, the chapter will describe the kind of signals that can be obtained from an bioelectrical impedance plethysmography device on the forearm. This section will describe the different waves that can be obtained like basal impedance, venous occlusion plethysmography and the arterial pulse amplitude.

The chapter four will describe the work performed to develop a bioelectrical impedance plethysmography device from scratch. The electrical characteristics of the device will be described including frequency of operation and maximum current delivery. The designed device has a modular approach, so different modules were designed. All the designs and principle of operation are described starting from the driving circuit which includes the power supply, wave generation circuit using a DDS, wave amplitude control using differential amplifiers and current delivery using a modified Howland circuit. The detection circuits will be reported of how current and voltage information is gathered and decodifed from the hardware point of view. 

The chapter five described the experimental procedure performed to gather data from participant's left arm. The instruments and locations of sensors is showed for the experiment. All the procedure and methods will be presented in detail, including the different pressures applied to the cuff in the upper arm to alter the blood flow of the arm. This chapter will also describe the nature of the data acquired, software front end to capture data and post processing. All the algorithms and mathematical formulas will be presented showing how blood flow can be estimated from some of the instruments and the bioelectrical impedance methods.  

\rvmynote{Check if I finally joined the chapter six and seven}
The following chapters describe analysis of the signals obtained. The chapters six analyses the basal impedance from the measurement taken during the experiment. By isolating the basal readings during the experiments, it was analysed possible causes of errors during the measurements and unwanted signals. The chapter seven describes the effect of occlusion on the basal impedance during the three different kind of occlusion, below systolic pressure, in between systolic and diastolic and during total occlusion. Within this chapter, it will be calculated the blood flow using the theory and equations gathered in chapter four. Chapter eight will be focused on the analysis of the waveform shape of the arterial pulses during during the experiment, including the changes in three different points in the plethysmographic waveform. From here, the calculation of blood flow from the waveform will be described. 

Chapters nine and ten, present the data from the other collected from the other instruments and the correlation with the bioelectrical impedance plethysmography. It will be presented now the signals from iPG at different levels of occlusion correlated with the arterial flow of ultrasound Doppler. the changes of amplitude pulses in PPG and the movement of red cells in laser Doppler flowmetry. 

Each chapter will include a conclusion, depicting the most relevant information acquired. However, the chapter eleven will show a general discussion of the performance of the bioelectrical impedance plethysmography device and how correlated, the measurements are with other instruments. Furthermore, the difference in arterial pulses during venous occlusion and partial arterial occlusion will provide a clue on how could be possible to differentiate between arterial and venous restriction of flow.
