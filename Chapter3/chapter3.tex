This document proposes the design of a device able to monitor blood flow continuously and able to distinguish between venous and arterial occlusions using bioelectrical impedance. This chapter describes the principles behind bioelectrical impedance plethysmography which is the method used to acquire the physiological measurements. The first section covers the theory of bioelectrical impedance and how an electromagnetic wave interacts with the cells, the electrode conflict and the impedance plethysmography principles. 

\mynote{This introduction must be complemented once I complete the whole chapter}


\section{Bioelectrical impedance}
Before describing how impedance plethysmography operates, it is better to understand how the principle of bioelectrical impedance is defined. First of all, the term electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is referred as the study of the absorption of energy depending upon the frequency of electromagnetic (EM) waves. When measurements are performed in a biological sample, then this method could be referred either as electrical impedance or bioelectrical impedance~\cite{ivorra2003bioimpedance}. The term to be used in this document will be bioelectrical electrical impedance. The EM spectrum is quite broad, and the interaction with tissue occurs in the frequency range from \SIrange[scientific-notation = engineering]{100}{10000000}{\hertz}~\cite{bertemes2002tissue}. In this thesis, the frequencies of interest are focused in the low-frequency range. Indeed, plethysmography devices operate commonly in the bandwidth below few \si{\kilo\hertz}.

The human body is constituted by four basic tissues known as epithelium which covers and protects the whole surface of the body, muscle which is in charge of the movement, connective tissue that supports and protect organs, and nervous tissue which provides the internal transmission line for the electrical impulses coming from the brain. Cells that constitute these tissues play a fundamental role in terms of current conduction when an analogue current (AC) is applied to the body~\cite{lvovich2012impedance}. Hence, impedance readings vary according to the parameters of these cells as well as its protein content. It is especially significant to understand the geometry and characteristics of the blood cells, which transport $0_2$ around the body. The functionality of these cells and amount per \si{\micro\litre} of human blood were described by table \ref{table:cell} in section \ref{section literature 1}.

As can be noticed from that table, RBC's statistically are more numerous than the other cells and it has particular resistive properties. Its disk shape can be ideally represented as a spherical particle with membranes around the surface, as represented by Figure \ref{fig:cell}. Live cells can be represented as multilayer cells where its internal cytoplasm has a characteristic permittivity ($\epsilon_{cp}$) and conductivity ($\rho_{cp}$). Likewise, these characteristics are similar to the one surrounding the cell called extracellular fluid ($\epsilon_m$ and $\rho_m$). However, the membrane has a very low permittivity ($\epsilon_{MBR}$) and conductivity ($\rho_{MBR}$) behaving as a dielectric. In contrast in dead cells the membrane becomes loose and does not provide resistance to electric current~\cite{lvovich2012impedance}.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]

Membrane permittivity described as ($\epsilon_{MBR}$) and conductivity ($\rho_{MBR}$).}
	\label{fig:cell}
\end{figure}

A cell can change its internal cytoplasm by two different means either changing the permeability of their bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) or by using ionic channels or pumps. The BLM is about \SI{7}{\nano\meter} thick, by altering its permeability it allows lipids and water molecules to pass through~\cite{ivorra2003bioimpedance}. The interface extracellular-membrane-intracellular ($\rho_m \rightarrow \rho_{MBR} \leftarrow \rho_{cp}$) behaves as a capacitor because the membrane is a dielectric between two conductors, which is represented as $C_m$ in figure \ref{fig:cell model}.

On the other hand, parallel to BLM the ionic channels and pumps enhance membrane’s functionality. Ionic channels or “channel proteins” allow transport and exchange of certain types of ions such as $Na^{+}$, $K^{+}$, Chloride ($Cl^{-}$) and Calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) between the inside and outside of the cell~\cite{lvovich2012impedance}. Ion pumps are caused by sensitivity of the membrane to a voltage; it is also responsible for the membrane’s non–linear properties to low voltage. This pump also causes cell polarisation that allows the flow of ion charges in the body. Electrically, these channels act as a resistor ($R_m$).

	\caption[Electrical model of the cell]{Electrical model of the cell and its simplified version. $R_e$ is the resistivity of the extracellular medium, $R_i$ is the resistivity of the intracellular medium and $R_m$ and $C_m$ are the resistivity and capacitance of the membrane.}
	\label{fig:cell models}
\end{figure*}

According to previous analysis, the cell can be simplified in an equivalent electric circuit model as shown in Figure \ref{fig:cell models}. This model shows that if AC is pumped into the extracellular medium, there are two possible paths for the current to go through. One way is around the cell which is represented by the resistive characteristic of the extracellular medium ($R_e$). In the second route, current flows through the cell. Indeed, AC may flow initially either over the BLM which is a represented as a capacitance ($C_m$) or across ionic channels ($R_m$).Once in the cell, current travels via the intracellular medium ($R_i$) that is mostly resistive. Lastly, the electrical current leaves the cell through the membrane, which it is again the same $C_m$ and $R_m$.

Since $C_m$ and $R_m$ have the same values when the current enters and exits the cell, this can be simplified in the electric model as two resistors in series ($2R_m$) and two capacitances in parallel ($C_m/2$) as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:cell simp model}.

When an EM field is applied to the tissue, cells respond according to the frequency applied showing three distinctive areas in the spectrum as described by Schawn et al.~\cite{schwan1957electrical,schwan1962electrical}. Figure \ref{fig:ABG dispersion} displays the dielectric response against frequency, which reveals valuable information about the functional and structural properties of the cell~\cite{lvovich2012impedance}. According to the graph, there are three denominating areas $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ dispersion. Firstly, $\alpha$ dispersion (from \SI{10}{\hertz} to a few \si{\kilo\hertz}) is generally associated with frequency dependent properties of the cells’ membrane. Secondly, $\beta$ dispersion (\SI{10}{\kilo\hertz} to several \si{\mega\hertz}) is related to the dielectric property of the cell membrane and the interaction between the internal and external mediums. Finally, $\gamma$ dispersion (> \SI{10}{\giga\hertz}) is due to dielectric relaxation of bulk dispersing media, the Debye dispersion in water (\SI{17}{\giga\hertz}) and the presence of small molecules. 

\begin{figure}[!htpb]

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,keepaspectratio, trim={0cm 1cm 0cm 0cm},clip]{figure3}    
	\caption[Alpha, Bet y Gama dispersion]{Representation of a cell with its electric characteristics. Internal cytoplasm characteristic permittivity $\epsilon_{cp}$ and conductivity $\rho_{cp}$. Extracellular fluid permittivity $\epsilon_m$ and conductivity $\rho_m$). Membrane permittivity described as ($\epsilon_{MBR}$) and conductivity ($\rho_{MBR}$).}
	\label{fig:ABG dispersion}
\end{figure}

In addition, the $\beta$ dispersion region provides supplementary information about the cell. Lvovich \cite{lvovich2012impedance} has divided this area into three subregions depending on the interaction of the electrical current with the cell. The $\beta_1$ relaxation is due to the capacitive membrane $C_m$, occurring in the low \si{\kilo\hertz} range. When the frequency is increased between \si{\kilo\hertz} and low \si{\mega\hertz} range the internal cytoplasm of the cell can produce a $\beta_3$ dispersion because of a change from resistive to capacitive conduction. However, this capacitive component is often disregarded simplifying the model into just a resistive element $R_i$. Ultimately, $\beta_2$ happens in the range of low \si{\mega\hertz} when the electrical charge movement through the cell shifts to a capacitive conduction.

This research document is centred in the $\beta$ dispersion region between \SIrange[scientific-notation = engineering]{100}{1000000}{\hertz}. The impedance plethysmography device designed described in chapter \ref{chapter design} is capable to operate within this bandwidth. 

The ideal electrical model of the cell shown in figure \ref{fig:cell models} is a very close approximation that allows predicting bioelectrical impedance behaviour for dilute cell suspension. However, tissue is more complex than this having extra components to be analysed. For instance, tissue like muscle exhibits extreme anisotropy (conductivity is not the same when measured in different directions) \cite{lvovich2012impedance,dean2008electrical,foster1995dielectric}. Therefore, the position where electrodes are placed influences in the impedance of the readings. Also the change of volume of the blood vessels during the heart’s systole and diastole also changes impedance magnitude readings which is the principle used by impedance plethysmography. 

Another example of this is in the myocardial muscle studied in pigs where two superimposed depressions were observed in-between \SIrange[scientific-notation = engineering]{10}{1000000}{\hertz} ~\cite{casas1999vivo}. Different resistivity values have been obtained when measuring bioelectrical impedance during the cardiac cycle longitudinally and transversally \cite{steendijk1993four}. \mynote{Maybe this paragraph is not requires as might refer to death cells rather than plethysmography}

\subsection{Mathematical representation of electrical impedance}
Different mathematical models have been studied based on the ideal and basic model shown in figure \ref{fig:cell simp model}. Still, this model does not completely represent the effect of the membrane at high frequencies. Debye produced the following equation that took into account suspension of free poles \cite{bertemes2002tissue}.

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:Debye}
	\varepsilon_r^* = \varepsilon_{HF} + \frac{\varepsilon_{LF} - \varepsilon_{HF}}{1 + j \omega \tau}
\end{align}

In this equation, $\varepsilon_r^*$ represents the complex relative permeability, $\varepsilon_{LF}$ and $\varepsilon_{HF}$ denotes permeability at low and high frequency respectively and $\tau$ is the relaxation time constant. Finally, $j \omega =2 \pi$ indicates the angular frequency in radians. However, it was not until 1941 when Cole brothers with their empirical work took into account dispersion by including in the Debye equation an additional parameter called $\alpha$, resulting in equation \ref{eq:cole cole}. Presently, this equation is widely used to get the approximate value of impedance when taking biomedical measurements \cite{cole1941dispersion}.

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:cole cole}
	\varepsilon_r^* = \varepsilon_{HF} + \frac{\varepsilon_{LF} - \varepsilon_{HF}}{(1 + j \omega \tau)^{1-\alpha}}
\end{align}

Parameter $\alpha$ is limited for values between 0 and 1. When its value is equal to zero, the Cole–Cole equation will give the Debye equation as a solution for polar dielectrics as expressed in equation \ref{eq:Debye}. Consequently, from this mathematical statement is possible to obtain data representation known as the Cole–Cole plot, which is a two dimensional graph where the plot of $\varepsilon \prime\prime$ or the imaginary part of the equation is in the y axis vs. $\varepsilon \prime$ in the $x$ which is the real part of the solution. However, this is not the only alternative to plot the results J. Ross Macdonald~\cite{macdonald2005impedance, macdonald1992impedance} has also suggested a representation of the data in a three–dimensional plot between the previous variables plus frequency in logarithmic scale $\log_{10}(f)$.

\section{Impedance plethysmography principle} %Section - 1.1                                                                                                                                                                                                 
\label{section impedance 1}
Referred as impedance plethysmography (iPG) involves the measurement of the change of impedance due to change of blood flow. For instance, when heart’s systole increases blood flow, the volume of a limb rises due to the inflow of blood (swelling)~\cite{martinsen2011bioimpedance}. Consequently, there are changes of impedance correlated to the changes of volume and flow in a limb. Some medical application might require the use of occlusion cuffs to analyse venous filling. There are several medical applications for this kind of technique such as heart stroke volume (SV) measurement, cardiac output (CO), thoracic respiratory volume, oedema and detection of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)~\cite{holohan1996plethysmography}.

As previously described in section \ref{section literature 3.5}, iPG is the measurement of volume changes through the equivalent bioelectrical impedance of a part of the human body~\cite{corciova2011peripheral}. In this document is presented the measurements from an in-vivo studio of the plethysmographic changes in a segment of the left forearm. As it can be deduced, one would assume that this segment of the upper limb could be modelled as a cylinder within a cylinder. Where the inner cylinder represents a blood vessel and the outermost is the surrounding tissue. 

For mathematical analysis, a single cylinder will be initially studied and then the double cylinder model. An ideal circular solid model can be applied where the cross-sectional area might have a circular or elliptical form. Hence, measurement of electrical impedance might depend on its geometry. The following equation illustrates the segment’s geometry effects either conductance ($G$) or resistance ($R$). However, this document will use the resistance equivalent during the mathematical explanation.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:resistivity}
R=\sigma\frac{L}{A}
\end{align}

where $\rho$ is the tissue’s conductivity, $A$ the cross sectional area of the cylinder and $L$ its length. From conductance equation can be deducted that if length increases conductance will decrease. Opposite, if the volume of the cross section $A$ increases then conductivity will increase. A representation of this cylinder can be seen in \ref{fig:cylinder model}. Hence, it is possible to find the volume as function of its resistance can be described with the following equation.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:volume (R)}
v=G \rho L^2 = R\sigma A^2 = \frac{1}{R} \frac{L^2}{\sigma}
\end{align}

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=5.5cm,keepaspectratio]{figure4}    
	\caption[Cylinder model for impedance calculation]{Cylinder model of length L and parallel volume increment}
	\label{fig:cylinder model}
\end{figure}
 

It must be noticed from the previous equation that if $L$ is constant then volume $v$ is directly proportional to the conductance $G$. However, if the presumption is that the area $A$ is constant then volume $v$ is directly proportional to resistance $R$. In the case of human blood vessels, it is expected that swelling occurs transversely. In this case, a rise of volume $\Delta v$  is better represented as conductance increase in a parallel model~\cite{martinsen2011bioimpedance}. Hence, when a variation of volume $\Delta v$ occurs a change of impedance $\Delta G$ might also be present. As a result, both entities can be expressed as a relation between two parameters as shown in the equation below.

 \mynote{Probably I should use the description I made from the Nyober equation}

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:volume (deltav)}
	\frac{\Delta G}{G} = \frac{\Delta v}{v} \qquad\text{or}\qquad \frac{\Delta G}{G} = \frac{\sigma}{L^2} \qquad\text{or}\qquad \Delta v = \Delta G \rho L^2
\end{align}


The same equation can be also represented as function of a change of resistivity $\Delta R$. In this case the equation changes to \ref{eq:volume (deltaR)}. It must be kept in mind that the minus sign represents that a resistance increase corresponds a volume decrease \cite{martinsen2011bioimpedance}. 
 
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:volume (deltaR)}
	 \Delta v \cong \Delta R \rho \bigg( \frac{L}{R} \bigg)^2 \qquad (\Delta R \ll R)
\end{align}

Nevertheless, a human body segment could be sculpted as two-compartment cylinder model where length $L$ is constant and the two cylinders are physically in parallel (see figure \ref{fig:two cylinder modell}). Supposing that the volume of the inner cylinder is equivalent to $\Delta v + v_A$ and $v_t$ is the constant outer cylinder volume. Then, the following equation represents the change in conductivity when both tubes swell $(\Delta v > 0)$. From that equation can be deduced that the problem of high sensitivity plethysmography depends on selectively measuring the immittance in a selected volume~\cite{martinsen2011bioimpedance}.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=5.5cm,keepaspectratio]{figure5}    
	\caption[Two compartment cylinder model]{Two compartment cylinder model of length L and parallel volume increment}
	\label{fig:two cylinder modell}
\end{figure}

In this case, the conductivities and cross section areas from surrounding tissue ($\sigma_t$) with area $A_t$ and tissue ($\sigma_b$) with area $A_b$ will also contribute towards the total conductance $G$ of the segment. Consequently, considering constant geometry, the conductance of these two cylinders could be expressed as the following equation.

\begin{align}
G = (\sigma_b A_b + \sigma_t A_t) \frac{1}{L}
\end{align}

However, the previous equation does not represent plethysmography because area change has not been assumed when swelling occurs. But as Grimmes et al.~\cite{martinsen2011bioimpedance} describes the previous equation 'relates to flow system with a varying conductivity of the passing liquid, and flow with time is volume'.

But a segment of human body limb is a dynamic system where the cross sectional area changes with the pulsatile movement of the arteries.  For instance, when a blood bolus volume goes through an artery there is a temporary increase of local volume during heart systole (see figure \ref{fig:cylinder bolus}). There are different blood flows occurring during a heart cycle in the inner cylinder of the selected segment that is the blood vessel. First, during inflow phase blood vessel is filled, then during outflow phase, the diastole heart cycle transports blood further down but at the same time is returning through the venous system.


\begin{figure}[!htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=7cm,keepaspectratio]{figure6}    
	\caption[Four electrodes placement for iPG]{Four electrodes system with the effect of a bolus of blood passing through a selected segment}
	\label{fig:cylinder bolus}
\end{figure}

For this reason tetrapolar method or four electrodes measurement are desirable as displayed in figure \ref{fig:cylinder bolus}. Some of the reasons exposed are that is easier to confine the measured tissue volume to the area of the volume increase. Also, the sensitivity will depend on the bolus length in relation to the measured distance between electrodes may also increase sensitivity~\cite{porter1985measurement}.


%********************************** %Second Section  *************************************
\subsection{Blood contribution to impedance} %Section - 3.2.1
As it has been described impedance plethysmography relies on the change of volume caused by blood vessels filling up all along the cardiac cycle. Nonetheless, blood is highly conductive and influences the amplitude of the waveform. However, there are also particular properties that might modify its intrinsic signal. In one of the earliest research about the conductivity of blood, Sigman et al.~\cite{sigman1937effect} \mynote{Check if I can find a more updated version of this} demonstrated that resistivity of blood depends on its flow.  It was found that when blood velocity decreased from \SIrange{10}{40}{\centi\meter\per\second} its resistivity fell roughly \SI{7}{\percent}. Blood can be simplified as a suspension of particles (erythrocytes or RDC) with a high resistivity floating in a conductive medium (plasma). The rest of blood’s cells do not represent a great component in the change of impedance because of its small size in comparison with the erythrocytes (see table \ref{table:cell}). In fact, the Sigman effect is not presented in either plasma or electrolytes~\cite{tremper1990principles}.  

It has also been proved that blood is electrically anisotropic because of the orientation of the RBC’s \cite{Visser1992Electric}. Moreover, geometry and orientation also affect the reading of resistivity. Which also means that direction of measurement also affects the readings. 
 

%********************************** % Second Section  *************************************
\section{Electrode conflict}  %Section - 3.2 
\label{section impedance 2}
Electrodes play a key feature in a bioelectrical impedance system. The right electrode geometry, distance and material may influence in the readings from a biological sample. Consequently, it is needed to use electrodes that have minor impedance compared to the one from the subject under test. Currently, most common materials used in bioelectrical impedance are platinum (\textit{Pt}), gold (\textit{Au}) or stainless steel. Other independent variables such temperature, ionic tissue contents and protein adhesion influence in the change of electrode impedance~\cite{ivorra2003bioimpedance,martinsen2011bioimpedance}. The geometry of the electrode also affects its resistance ($R$) as explain by ohm’s law in equation \ref{eq:resist}.

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:resist}
	R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\end{align}

where $\rho$ is the electrical resistivity of the material, $A$ is the area of the electrode and $L$ its longitude or thickness. As it can be noticed, the resistance ($R$) reduces when the area ($A$) of the electrode increases. However, the total resistance ($R$) is directly proportional to the electrodes length. 

When an electrode adheres to the skin, and electrical current passes through, a physical effect takes place. First, there is an electrical charge change from electronic to ionic conduction because inside the body the latter is only possible. Second, at the electrode–tissue boundary an electrochemical reaction follows, called electrolysis. This effect creates a “double layer capacitance (DLC)” (see figure \ref{fig:DLC}) that as its name indicates, adds a capacitive effect to boundary \cite{lvovich2012impedance}.  Consequently, applying an AC waveform inverts the electrode’s polarity during each cycle minimising this capacitive effect. However, this is a frequency dependent development, which means that at low frequencies can be quite notorious \cite{bertemes2002tissue}.

\end{figure}

\mynote{I have to reference this section. I think is from Martinesen}

An electric circuit model can represent the electric–tissue interface; this simplified electric representation is shown in figure \ref{fig:e-t circuit}. In more detail, this model is characterised by a charge transfer resistance ($R_{CT}$) in parallel with interface’s impedance ($Z_{CPE}$) in series with the tissue impedance ($Z_t$).  Some authors have defined the interface’s impedance as either a constant phase angle impedance ($Z_{CPA}$)~\cite{franks2005impedance} or constant phase element ($C_{PE}$) \cite{barsoukov2005impedance,mcadams2006characterization}. 

\begin{figure}[!htpb]

	\includegraphics[width=4.5cm,keepaspectratio]{figure8}    
	\caption[Equivalent circuit electrode–tissue interface]{Equivalent circuit electrode–tissue interface (Adapted from Franks~\cite{franks2005impedance})}
	\label{fig:e-t circuit}
\end{figure}

The value of $Z_{ZPA}$ can be calculated from the following empirical equation \ref{eq:zcpa} given by McAdams~\cite{mcadams1995linear}.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:zcpa}
Z_{CPA} = K(j\omega)^{-\beta}
\end{align}

where $K$ is a measure of the magnitude of $Z_{CPA}$, $\beta$ is a constant ($0 \leq \beta \leq 1$) representing inhomogeneities in the surface (typically \num{0.8} for many biomedical electrode systems) and $\omega = 2\pi f$. When $\beta = 1$, $Z_{CPE}$ is equivalent a purely capacitive impedance element \cite{franks2005impedance,mcadams2006characterization,mcadams1995linear}.

Electrodes are also a source of error when taking measurements. Some blunders can even distort the original signal; such as thermal noise also known as Johnson-Nyquist noise. This type of noise is entirely inherent to the electrode and also depends on other external variables.  The equation \ref{eq:nyquist noise} represents the level of noise coming from the electrode~\cite{mcadams1995linear}.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:nyquist noise}
V_n(rms)=\sqrt{(4 K_b T R \Delta f)}
\end{align}

where $K_b$ is Boltzman constant, $T$ is absolute temperature, $R$ is the electrode’s resistance and $\Delta f$ is the bandwidth of the measurements. 

In summary, it can be appreciated that the noise ($V_n(rms)$) is directly proportional the bandwidth’s measurements ($\Delta f$). At high operating frequency is expected a higher the level of noise. In the case of impedance plethysmography the bandwidth is in the lower range of \si{\kilo\hertz} which minimises the effect of the Johnson-Nyquist noise.

Another source of errors caused by electrode can be derived from their position in the body, lack of surface contact or mismatch in materials and geometries. Therefore, to improve and maximise the area of contact, some electrodes requires of conductive gel. It has been demonstrated that using commercially available electrodes for electrocardiogram (ECG) purposes does provide good impedimetric readings, compared to specially designed electrodes~\cite{caicedo2012use}.

An experiment using this type of electrodes was carried out to determine whether removing one or four electrodes and then put them back in the same position could produce errors in readings. It was found that putting electrodes away and then adhere them again within an extended period represented a minimum change in impedance readings. Most of the changes were presented in variations in the geometry of the segment under test caused by the electrode's reposition that might have varied either the current path or the voltage reading. One of the most important conclusions was that a way to cancel out the effect of electrode repositioning the measurement should be calculating the impedance ratio at different frequencies~\cite{lozano1997electrode}.

At the moment of taking measurements for localised bioelectrical impedance using tetrapolar configuration, the distribution of the electrodes affects the sensitivity of the system as well as the geometry of the cells containing within the tissue ~\cite{bertemes2002tissue}. Experiments found that separation of injection and detection electrode pairs affects current penetration depth. In other words, the largest the separation between the pair of electrodes the deepest the AC signal could go.

%********************************** % Third Section  *************************************
\section{Geselowitz theorem}  %Section - 3.3 

Geselowitz \cite{geselowitz1971application} studied the change in conductivity within a constant geometry. In short, his analysis applied the lead field theory into impedance plethysmography. Simplifying the origin of the equation, the total impedance of the whole volume is equivalent to the sum of all the small impedances within each small volume $dV$~\cite{martinsen2011bioimpedance}.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=6.3cm,keepaspectratio]{figure9}    
	\caption[Volume conductor with 4 electrodes]{Volume conductor $V$ of conductivity $\sigma_1$. A:B represent current injection electrodes and C:D are sensing electrodes.}
	\label{fig:volume}
\end{figure}


The analysis of this equation starts from the study of the four-electrode measurement and the change in conductivity of the internal region of a volume conductor \cite{bertemes2002tissue}. From Figure \ref{eq:potential field} is assumed that a volume conductor is electrically linear and surrounded by an insulator $\xi$. If the internal conductivity changes from $\sigma_1$ to $\sigma_2$ (equivalent to $\sigma_1+\Delta \sigma$) then the potential field of the current injection will change from $\phi$ to $\phi \prime$ (equal to $\phi+\Delta \phi$) but sensing potential field $\psi$ will remain unchanged. Then the field equation can be written as follows:

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:potential field}
	\int_{\Omega} \sigma . (\phi - \phi \prime) . \nabla \psi d \overline{S} = \int_{V} (\sigma_1 - \sigma_2).(\nabla \phi \prime \bullet \nabla \psi).dV 
\end{align}

By replacing the terms by the equivalents, the equation can be rewritten according to the next equation.

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:potential field2}
	- \Delta \phi_{CD} . (-I_{\psi}) = - \int_{V} \Delta \sigma . [\nabla (\phi + \Delta \phi) \bullet \nabla \psi].dV
\end{align}

The impedance change can be deducted by dividing the function by the currents involved $I_{phi}$ and $I_{\psi}$. As a result, the Geselowitz’s equation is equivalent to:

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:Geselowitz}
	\Delta Z = \frac{\Delta \phi_{CD}}{I_\phi} = - \int_V \Delta \sigma (x,y,z).\bigg[\frac{\nabla(\phi + \Delta \phi)}{I_{\phi}} \bullet \frac{\nabla \psi}{I_{\psi}}\bigg].dV

The previous equation is the key to calculating the change in impedance in a volume within defined boundaries. However, this only applies to homogeneous and isotropic volume conductors. This equation can be simplified if is assumed that a unit of current passes through and the volume conductor can be denoted by a number of discrete elements of uniform conductivity in three dimensional space ($x,y,z$). As a result, the equitation can be simplified as follows:

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:Geselowitz2}
	\Delta Z = - \Delta \sigma \cdot \int_V \nabla(\phi + \Delta \phi) \bullet \nabla \psi . dV = - \Delta \sigma \cdot S
\end{align}

where $S$ represents the sensitivity matrix in three dimensions, and it is independent of conductance. Calculate this variable requires a series of assumptions such as the initial conductivity distribution is uniform \cite{dehghani1999incorporating}. This document is not centred in the mathematical analysis of the sensitivity S but to deduct that impedance changes are directly related to the change of geometry of the segment. Several studies have been proof that sensitivity varies according to the electrodes position and geometry as researched by Filho \cite{bertemes2002tissue}.
